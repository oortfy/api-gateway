# Swagger Documentation Implementation

This document describes how the Swagger/OpenAPI documentation was implemented in the API Gateway project.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Created Swagger Directory Structure**
   - Created `docs/swagger/` directory to host all Swagger-related files
   - Added placeholder `.dockerkeep` file to ensure directory exists in Git

2. **Created OpenAPI Specification**
   - Created `docs/swagger/swagger.yaml` with OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
   - Documented core endpoints, authentication methods, proxy patterns, and WebSocket support
   - Added detailed response schemas and security definitions

3. **Created Swagger UI**
   - Added `docs/swagger/index.html` with Swagger UI integration
   - Used CDN-hosted Swagger UI assets for simplicity
   - Configured UI to load the local `swagger.yaml` file

4. **Added Server Implementation**
   - Modified `internal/server/server.go` to serve Swagger documentation
   - Added route handler for the `/docs/swagger/` path
   - Used `http.FileServer` to serve static Swagger files

5. **Added Docker Support**
   - Updated `Dockerfile` to include Swagger documentation
   - Modified `.dockerignore` to explicitly include the `docs/swagger/` directory

6. **Added Validation**
   - Created `docs/swagger/validate.sh` script to validate the Swagger YAML
   - Used `swagger-cli` for validation

7. **Added Makefile Targets**
   - Added `swagger-validate` target to validate the Swagger documentation
   - Added `swagger-serve` target to serve the Swagger UI without running the full gateway

8. **Added Documentation**
   - Created `docs/swagger/README.md` with usage instructions
   - Updated main `README.md` to include information about the Swagger documentation
   - Created this `IMPLEMENTATION.md` document to explain the implementation process

## Directory Structure

```
docs/
└── swagger/
    ├── .dockerkeep           # Placeholder for Git
    ├── IMPLEMENTATION.md     # This file
    ├── README.md             # Usage documentation
    ├── index.html            # Swagger UI
    ├── swagger.yaml          # OpenAPI specification
    └── validate.sh           # Validation script
```

## Accessing the Documentation

When the API Gateway is running, the Swagger documentation is available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/docs/swagger/
```

For development purposes, it can also be served standalone with:

```
make swagger-serve
```

This will serve the documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8090/swagger/
```

## Maintaining the Documentation

When making changes to the API Gateway:

1. Update the `swagger.yaml` file to reflect new endpoints or changes
2. Run `make swagger-validate` to ensure the specification is valid
3. Restart the API Gateway to apply changes

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the Swagger documentation:

1. Generate the OpenAPI specification automatically from code annotations
2. Add more detailed examples and request/response samples
3. Add schema definitions for all data models used in the API
4. Implement swagger-ui directly in the API Gateway without relying on CDN assets
